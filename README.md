## **Fortytwo Product Roadmap**

We understand the importance of transparency and planning in achieving our goals and meeting our customers' needs. That's why we're excited to present our [Product Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/amestofortytwo/projects/12/views/1) â€”a dynamic tool that outlines our vision and strategy for the future of our flagship product, the Security Posture Portal (with many more to come!).

In this guide, we will walk you through the essentials of our roadmap and provide you with insights on how to read and use it effectively.

### **Why is our Product Roadmap Important?**

- **Alignment:** It aligns our teams and stakeholders around a common vision and set of objectives. Everyone understands where we're headed as a company and what's on the horizon.

- **Transparency:** It promotes transparency by sharing our strategic direction with customers, employees, and partners, fostering trust and credibility.

- **Prioritisation:** It helps prioritise our initiatives based on their importance and impact, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.

- **Communication:** It serves as a communication tool to keep everyone informed about upcoming changes and improvements.

## Understanding Our Product Roadmap
Our Product Roadmap is divided into key sections, each serving a specific purpose:

**1. Timeline** <br>
The timeline, which is clearly defined in the board via the vertical board lanes, is the backbone of the roadmap, illustrating the projected development milestones and expected releases. It offers a high-level view of when you can expect various updates and features to be rolled out.

**2. Categories or Themes** <br>
Our roadmap is organised into categories or themes, each representing a strategic focus area. This helps you quickly identify the areas of our product that are receiving attention and investment.

**3. Initiatives and Features** <br>
Within each category or theme, you'll find specific initiatives and features (labeled with a *feat:*) that are planned for development. These are the building blocks of our roadmap, showcasing what's in store for our product.

**4. Status Indicators** <br>
To provide you with a clear understanding of each initiative's progress, we use status indicators:

- **Under Review:** New requests, bug reports or initiatives we have received and are currently reviewing. Requested feature requests may or may not make it to our roadmap for one reason or another, but rest assure that we will provide you with a reason should your request not make the cut. If the request is not pursued, it will be marked as Closed.

- **Planned:** Initiatives we intend to work on or are currently working on will find themselves in their respective lanes in the timeline.

- **Closed (and shipped):** Initiatives that have been successfully delivered will be marked as Closed and labeled "shipped" to indicate that it's been released. 

- **Future**: New requests or initiatives that have been reviewed and accepted but not yet planned for. They can be labeled as either "discovering", which means we have decided to build it but are still figuring out *how* it will be done; or "exploring", which means we're considering building this feature but lack sufficient information or feedback to begin the design phase.

**5. Descriptions and Priorities** <br>
For each initiative or feature, we provide detailed descriptions and priorities. This helps you understand what each item entails and why it's important for our product's growth and improvement.

## **Using Our Product Roadmap Effectively**

Now that you understand the key components of our roadmap, here are some tips on how to use it effectively:

- **Stay Informed:** Regularly check our roadmap to stay informed about upcoming changes and enhancements to our product.

- **Set Expectations:** Share the roadmap with your team and stakeholders to set realistic expectations about future developments.

- **Provide Feedback:** We value your input. If you have suggestions or feedback on the roadmap, please let us know by adding your comments directly into the roadmap. Your insights can influence our priorities.

- **Monitor Updates:** As initiatives move through their lifecycle, monitor the roadmap for updates on their progress and completion.
